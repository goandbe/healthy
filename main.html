              <p class="pmain">I have a hard time getting myself to simply start exercising or eating right. I've found that this series of motivators really helps.</p>
              <ul>
              	<li id="para"><img src="img/bike.jpg"/> Lifestyle <p>The first things to remember is that you're not starting a diet or a one-time exercise plan to lose weight or get fit for a week. You're beginning a lifestyle of healthy living. If that's too much for you, though, try it for a month and see how you feel. You may just want to revisit this tip.</p></li>
                
                <li><img src="img/pen.jpg"/> Goals<p>Like I said, it's a lifestyle, which is a rather large commitment. The best way for me to really keep with it is to write down why I'm doing it. Then, when I'm frustrated and want to give up, I can go back to my list of goals and get excited all over again.</p><p>Assignment number one: write down some goals of your own. Ask yourself why you want to be healthy. Is it to feel better about yourself? Gain confidence?  You decide!</p></li>
                
                <li><img src="img/sandp.jpg"/> Buddy System<p>Working out was especially hard for me until I found a friend to work out with. I know it's not always practical, as everyone has different schedules, but finding someone who also wants to become healthy can help you remain accountable. Plus, you can trade notes and see how you're both dealing with different issues. </p></li>
                
                <li><img src="img/table.jpg"/> Network<p>Much the same as the Buddy System, except this includes more people, making you even more accountable. Networking is all about finding which of your friends are trying to get healthy as well, and creating new friends who are doing the same thing. This is helpful because if your go-to exercising buddy is busy one week, you have plenty of other people you know work out and would love to have you tag along! </p></li>

              <p class="pmain">If you're interested in the healthy way to lose weight, it's all about burning more calories than you take in. Keeping that weight off and remaining healthy means lifestyle changes. I know it sounds sort of overwhelming, but it's really very simple. Here are some tips for exercising and eating right:</p>
              <div class="twoup">
              	<h3><img src="img/bike2.jpg"/>Exercise</h3>
                <p>The recommended exercise level a week is at least 2 hours and 30 minutes of moderate activity or an hour and 15 minutes of intense activity paired with muscle-strengthening exercise on two days of the week.  Sound intimidating? Let's break it down:</p>
                <p>2 hours and 30 minutes can translate to a walk, run, or elliptical workout of 30 minutes a day for five days a week. That's not so bad, right?</p>
                <p>If you're still having qualms about exercising, let me tell you, it's all about moving more you than would regularly. This means parking farther away from the grocery store, choosing stairs over the elevator, or really getting into vacuuming. Be creative. Think of some ways you move more in your daily life.</p>
                <p>Remember: exercising means building muscle. If you find yourself plateauing, don't lose hope; it just means you're taking on some muscle weight. Hello, strong arms. Let's go lift that car over there. </p>

              <div class="twoup">
              	<h3><img src="img/fork.jpg"/>Eating Right</h3>
                <p>Eating right is all about those fruits and veggies, right along with lean protein, whole grains, and low-fat dairy. Basically? Eating more of all those things you know you should, and less of the ones you shouldn't. Sounds boring, doesn't it? It doesn't have to be. Pop over to the "eat" tab and check out some of the fun recipes, blogs, and cookbooks that have healthy, yummy food.</p>
                <p>Remember: just because it's "all natural" doesn't mean it's good for you. Juice drinks are very guilty of this. They say they're all natural, but don't bother to point out that they have the same sugar level as pop. Get down and dirty; stare at those nutritional facts and put all natural in its place!</p>
