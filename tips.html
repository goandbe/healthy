Keeping that weight off and remaining healthy means lifestyle changes. I know it sounds sort of overwhelming, but it's really very simple. Here are some tips for exercising and eating right:</p>
              <div class="twoup">
              	<h3><img src="img/bike2.jpg"/>Exercise</h3>
                <p>The recommended exercise level a week is at least 2 hours and 30 minutes of moderate activity or an hour and 15 minutes of intense activity paired with muscle-strengthening exercise on two days of the week.  Sound intimidating? Let's break it down:</p>
                <p>2 hours and 30 minutes can translate to a walk, run, or elliptical workout of 30 minutes a day for five days a week. That's not so bad, right?</p>
                <p>If you're still having qualms about exercising, let me tell you, it's all about moving more you than would regularly. This means parking farther away from the grocery store, choosing stairs over the elevator, or really getting into vacuuming. Be creative. Think of some ways you move more in your daily life.</p>
                <p>Remember: exercising means building muscle. If you find yourself plateauing, don't lose hope; it just means you're taking on some muscle weight. Hello, strong arms. Let's go lift that car over there. </p>

              	<h3><img src="img/fork.jpg"/>Eating Right</h3>
                <p>Eating right is all about those fruits and veggies, right along with lean protein, whole grains, and low-fat dairy. Basically? Eating more of all those things you know you should, and less of the ones you shouldn't. Sounds boring, doesn't it? It doesn't have to be. Pop over to the "eat" tab and check out some of the fun recipes, blogs, and cookbooks that have healthy, yummy food.</p>
                <p>Remember: just because it's "all natural" doesn't mean it's good for you. Juice drinks are very guilty of this. They say they're all natural, but don't bother to point out that they have the same sugar level as pop. Get down and dirty; stare at those nutritional facts and put all natural in its place!</p>
